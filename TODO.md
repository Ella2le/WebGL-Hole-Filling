## ToDo

* `Critical` Test collision not only with filling, but the whole mesh

* `Bug` Filled parts in models show dark triangles with phong shading (inverted face normals?)

* `Improve` Parallelization through Workers
* `Improve` Refine AFM based on Poisson equation OR radial basis functions
* `Improve` Collision test in 3D (test if triangle sides collide with triangle surface)

* `Feature` Show in-between steps of filling
* `Feature` Drag&Drop files to import them.
* `Feature` Add filling algorithm: Volume based octree
